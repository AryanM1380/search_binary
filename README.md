## Introduction

Binary search is a common searching algorithm used to efficiently find a specific target value within a sorted list. This project provides a Python implementation of the recursive binary search algorithm. It's a useful algorithm to know, especially for job interviews or any scenario where you need to efficiently search for values in a sorted list.

## Features

- Implementation of the recursive binary search algorithm.
- Efficiently searches for a target value in a sorted list.

## Getting Started

To use this binary search algorithm in your own projects, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python installed.
3. Open the Python script containing the binary search function.

## Usage

You can use the binary search function by providing a sorted list and the target value you want to find. The function will return the index of the target value in the list or -1 if the target is not present.

Example usage:

```python
Mylist = [1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, 8, 9]
target = 3
Mylist.sort()

print(f'Target is found at index: {search(Mylist, target, 0, len(Mylist)-1)}')
```

In this example, the sorted list `Mylist` is `[1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12]`, and the target value is `3`. The binary search function will find the target at index `1` and print the output as "Target is found at index: 1".
